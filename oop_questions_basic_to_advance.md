Here are **20 eye-catching Dart OOP questions** with **real-life examples** to help students connect concepts to practical scenarios! 🚀🔥

### **🔰 Basic OOP Concepts in Dart**  

1️⃣ **📦 Class & Object**  
   - Create a **`Car`** 🚗 class with attributes like `brand`, `model`, and `year`. Instantiate multiple objects and print their details.  

2️⃣ **🔐 Encapsulation**  
   - Develop a **`BankAccount`** 🏦 class with a private `_balance` property and methods `deposit(amount)` & `withdraw(amount)`, ensuring the balance never goes negative.  

3️⃣ **🏗️ Constructor & Named Constructor**  
   - Create a **`Student`** 🎓 class with a default constructor and a **named constructor** `fromJson(Map<String, dynamic>)` to initialize data from a JSON object.  

4️⃣ **📚 Inheritance**  
   - Design a **`Shape`** 🖼️ class with a method `area()`. Create subclasses **`Circle`** ⚫ and **`Rectangle`** 🔲 that override `area()` based on their formulas.  

5️⃣ **♻️ Method Overriding & `super` Keyword**  
   - Create an **`Employee`** 👨‍💼 class with a `work()` method. Extend it into **`Developer`** 💻 and **`Manager`** 📊 classes with different `work()` responsibilities.  

6️⃣ **⚡ Static Variables & Methods**  
   - Create a **`Company`** 🏢 class with a static variable `companyName` and a static method `getCompanyName()` that returns the company name.  

7️⃣ **🎛️ Getter & Setter**  
   - Develop a **`Temperature`** 🌡️ class where the temperature is stored in Celsius but has a getter to return it in Fahrenheit.  

8️⃣ **🎭 Abstract Class & Polymorphism**  
   - Create an **abstract class** **`Device`** 📱💻 with a method `turnOn()`. Implement it in **`Laptop`** & **`Smartphone`**, each with its own `turnOn()` behavior.  

9️⃣ **🛠️ Interface Implementation**  
   - Define an **interface** `Eatable` 🍏 with a method `eat()`. Implement it in **`Fruit`** 🍎, **`Vegetable`** 🥦, and **`Meat`** 🍖 classes with different `eat()` implementations.  

🔟 **📜 Enum & Switch Case**  
   - Create an **enum** `OrderStatus` 🛒 with values `pending`, `shipped`, and `delivered`. Write a function that takes an `OrderStatus` and prints a message accordingly.

### **🚀 Advanced OOP Concepts in Dart**  

1️⃣1️⃣ **🏭 Factory Constructor**  
   - Design a **`DatabaseConnection`** 🛠️ class where only **one instance** can be created (**Singleton pattern**). Use a factory constructor to return the same instance every time.  

1️⃣2️⃣ **📝 Mixin Usage**  
   - Create a **mixin `Logger`** 📜 that provides a method `logMessage(String message)`. Apply this mixin to a `FileManager` 📂 class to log file operations.  

1️⃣3️⃣ **🔗 Method Chaining**  
   - Develop a **Builder pattern** for a **`Pizza`** 🍕 object where you can **chain methods** like `setCheese()`, `setToppings()`, and `build()`.  

1️⃣4️⃣ **➕ Operator Overloading**  
   - Create a **`Money`** 💰 class where the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Money` objects.  

1️⃣5️⃣ **⚙️ Dependency Injection**  
   - Create a **`PaymentService`** 💳 class that takes a `PaymentGateway` as a dependency (via **constructor injection**). Implement `PaypalGateway` and `StripeGateway` to process payments differently.  

1️⃣6️⃣ **🚨 Custom Exception Handling**  
   - Create a **`UserAuthentication`** 🔑 class that throws a **`LoginFailedException`** if credentials are incorrect.  

1️⃣7️⃣ **🧩 Generics & Type Constraints**  
   - Develop a **generic `DataStorage<T>`** class that can store and retrieve data but restrict it to **`int`** and **`String`** only.  

1️⃣8️⃣ **🔍 Reflection in Dart**  
   - Use `dart:mirrors` to inspect the properties and methods of a **`Car`** 🚙 class at runtime.  

1️⃣9️⃣ **⚡ Isolates & Multi-threading**  
   - Create a Dart program where a **`BackgroundTask`** 🏃‍♂️ runs in an `Isolate` while the main thread displays progress updates.  

2️⃣0️⃣ **🌊 Streams & Event Handling**  
   - Build a **`WeatherStation`** ☀️ class that streams temperature updates **every second**. Subscribe to this stream and display real-time weather updates.
