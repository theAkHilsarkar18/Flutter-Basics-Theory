# Dart Code Example: Inheritance, Mixin, and Abstract Classes

## Overview

This document demonstrates key concepts in Dart, including inheritance, mixins, and abstract classes. It provides a clear example of how each concept works and how they can be used in a Dart application.

---

### **1. Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The child class can access all the properties and methods of the parent class.

#### Example: Car Class Inheriting from Vehicle

```dart
// Parent class: Car
class Car {
  String? engine, wheels, steering, gearBox;

  // Constructor
  Car({this.engine, this.wheels, this.steering, this.gearBox});
}

// Child class: Facebook extends Car
class Facebook extends Car {
  String? color, company, model;

  // Constructor
  Facebook({this.color, this.company, this.model, String? engine, String? wheels, String? steering, String? gearBox}) 
      : super(engine: engine, wheels: wheels, steering: steering, gearBox: gearBox);
}
```

---

### **2. Mixin**

A **mixin** allows us to reuse code in multiple classes without needing to create an inheritance relationship. Mixins provide a way to add functionality to classes. They are faster and more efficient when we don't need to inherit the entire class.

#### Mixin Example: Animation and Click Events

```dart
// Mixin for Animation-related methods
mixin Animation {
  void pageTransition() {
    print("Page Transition...");
  }

  void scroll() {
    print("Scrolling...");
  }

  void crossFade();
}

// Mixin for ClickEvent-related methods
mixin ClickEvents {
  void click() {
    print("Click event triggered.");
  }
}

// A class that uses multiple mixins
class Home extends Hover with Animation, ClickEvents {
  @override
  void crossFade() {
    print("Cross Fade animation.");
  }
}

// Mixin class for hover effect (empty for now)
mixin class Hover {}
```

---

### **3. Abstract Classes**

An abstract class defines the structure for other classes but cannot be instantiated directly. Any class implementing the abstract class must define all of its methods.

#### Abstract Class Example:

```dart
// Abstract class: Normal
abstract class Normal {
  void create();
  void abstractMethod();
}

// Class A implements Normal
class A implements Normal {
  @override
  void create() {
    print("Create method implemented.");
  }

  @override
  void abstractMethod() {
    print("Abstract method implemented.");
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Main Function**

The `main()` function demonstrates how to create objects of the `A` class that implements the `Normal` abstract class.

```dart
void main() {
  // Creating an object of class A
  var n1 = A();
  n1.create();  // Calls the create method
  n1.abstractMethod();  // Calls the abstract method
}
```

---

### Summary of Concepts

1. **Inheritance**: The child class can access all methods and properties of the parent class.
2. **Mixin**: Mixins allow code reuse without inheritance, providing specific methods that can be added to classes.
3. **Abstract Classes**: Defines structure that other classes must follow. Methods in abstract classes need to be implemented by any class that implements them.

---

### Usage Notes

- **Inheritance** is useful when a child class should have all the properties and methods of a parent class.
- **Mixins** are more lightweight and allow code reuse without establishing a hierarchical relationship.
- **Abstract classes** enforce a structure and require derived classes to implement all abstract methods.

---

This structure should make the concepts clear and provide you with easy-to-follow examples. You can use or extend this code as needed for your application.
