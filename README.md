# Flutter Application

This project demonstrates the basics of a Flutter application. 

## Main Function

The `main` function initializes the Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Flutter

### Widgets
- Everything is a widget in Flutter.
- Every individual part of the UI is a widget.
- Multiple widgets make up a page/screen.
- Multiple pages/screens make up an application.

### Naming Conventions
- Every method/user-defined function/member function should start with a small letter and follow camelCase.
- Every class should start with a capital letter and follow CamelCase.
- In Flutter, every widget is a class.

### Widget Classification
- If any class is a part of the UI, it is a widget.
- If any class plays a supportive role with a widget or provides any functionality, it is not necessarily a widget.

### Types of Widgets
1. **Built-in Widgets**: Already defined in the library.
2. **User-defined Widgets**: Created by the user as per need.

## Flutter Concepts

### State
State is a type of data used in the UI.

### Static
Static means the data will not update/change/modify.

### Types of Widgets

1. **StatefulWidget**:
   - The state can be changed, making the UI dynamic.
   - Uses more memory compared to a StatelessWidget.

2. **StatelessWidget**:
   - The state is static.
   - Uses less memory compared to a StatefulWidget.

## Widget Interactions
- Widgets can connect with other widgets.
- `BuildContext`: Provides information about widgets in the widget tree and the sizing of the device.

## OOP Principles in Flutter

- **Inheritance**: To get all features and functionality of a stateless widget.
- **Data Abstraction**: The `build` method is an abstract method of the `StatelessWidget` class, so it must be declared in the child class.
- **Polymorphism**: The `build` method is created in the parent class and overridden in the child class.
- **Method Overriding**: When the parent class and child class have methods with the same name.

## Example: MyApp Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key}); // const constructor

  // super keyword is used to access attributes/method of parent class in child class.
  @override // notation for method overriding
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(),
    );
  }
}
```
```
